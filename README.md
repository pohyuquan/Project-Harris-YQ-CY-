In your README you should be very explicit about the datasources.  This is where we take citation seriously.
You should NOT, however, include a copy of that data in your repository if it exceeds a few megabytes.  Instead, you should describe how the data was cleaned and reduced.  The cleaning scripts are a fundamental part of your projects; they should be included in the repository and itemized in your README
You SHOULD include the fully processed data as a CSV or other, so that I can see what you're working with.
