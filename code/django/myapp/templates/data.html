<h1>Source Information</h1>
To investigate the relationship between fiscal expenditure on education and school
performance, we merged two datasets from 2008 to 2011: Fiscal data tables from
the U.S. Department of Education: National Center for Education Statistics and
Consolidated State Performance Report from U.S. Department of Education:
Office of Elementary and Secondary Education.

<h2>Fiscal Data Tables</h2>
Common Core of Data (CCD) is a program of the U.S. Department of
Education's <a href = "http://nces.ed.gov/">National Center for Education Statistics</a>
that annually collects fiscal and non-fiscal data about public schools, public school districts
and state education agencies in the United States.
The data are supplied by state education agency officials and include
information that describes schools and school districts, including name,
address, and phone number; descriptive information about students and staff,
including demographics; and fiscal data.
The fiscal data tables consolidates total students, revenues, current expenditures,
current expenditures per pupil, total expenditures, and total expenditures
per pupil for the 100 largest public elementary and secondary school districts
in the United States from 2008 to 2011.

<h2>Consolidated State Performance Report</h2>
The Consolidated State Performance dataset is part of the initiative of
<a href = "http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/oese/index.html">U.S. Department of Education: Office of Elementary and Secondary Education</a>
to put performance data at the center of policy,
management, and budget decisions for all K-12 educational programs.
The Consolidated State Performance Report (CSPR) is the state-level data collection of information related to the ESEA Goals.<br>
<li>Maintaining high standards of a minimum attaining proficiency or better in reading/language arts and mathematics</li>
<li>Safe, drug free and conducive learning environments
<li>100% high school graduation rates</li>
<br>

<h2>Data Cleaning and Merging </h2>
Even though the National Center for Education Statistics only collects
fiscal expenditure of the top 100 largest public elementary and secondary school
districts annually, 73 school districts consistently appeared in the top 100 over
a time period of four years. We then merged the appended fiscal data tables with
the Consolidated State Performance Report on school districts, state and year from 2008 to 2011.<br>
